#Mouse Accuracy Trainer
Hello,
This is the project I made after the two weeks of bootcamp. My project is a mouse accuracy trainer which aims to improve the users comfort with the mouse by clicking on targets as fast they can. 

On simple terms, the project is basically a target game. 

Improvement comes after lots of practice. Mouse improvement can be seen when the user's high score increases more after every turn.
